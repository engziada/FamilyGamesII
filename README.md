# Family Games II

A modern web-based platform for family-friendly multiplayer games with real-time gameplay.

## Project Description
A Flask-based web application that allows families and friends to play games together in real-time. Features three game modes:
- **Charades (بدون كلام)**: Players act out items while others guess
- **Pictionary (تعاضل)**: Players draw items while others guess
- **Trivia (بنك المعلومات)**: Multiple-choice trivia questions with AI translation

## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Flask + Flask-SocketIO
- eventlet (async I/O)
- SQLAlchemy (data management)
- Groq API key (for trivia translation)
- Additional requirements in `requirements.txt`
